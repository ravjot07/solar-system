    <h2>A Mercury Adventure</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, Mercury, the smallest planet in our solar system, felt like a speedy superhero. Imagine being the fastest kid on your block, that's Mercury! It zips around the Sun in just 88 days, making it the quickest planet. But Mercury isn't just about speed. This brave planet is also like a daring explorer standing right next to a roaring bonfire, facing temperatures up to 800 degrees during the day, hotter than the hottest oven! However, as the sun sets, Mercury turns into a snowball, with temperatures plummeting to minus 290 degrees, colder than the coldest winter's night. Despite this wild roller coaster of temperatures, Mercury stands firm, showcasing its shiny, gray, crater-covered surface like a proud warrior showing off his battle scars. Always remember Mercury, the fastest, bravest, and most extreme planet in our neighborhood, the solar system.</p>
    
    <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
    <p>Mercury's eccentric orbit takes it as close as 47 million km and as far as 70 million km from the sun. If one could stand on the surface of Mercury when it is at its closest point to the sun, the sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth. Mercury speeds around the sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 50 km (31 miles) per second, faster than any other planet. One Mercury solar day (one day-night cycle) equals 175.97 Earth days. Observers on Earth can watch Mercury pass across the face of the sun, an event called a transit, 13 times each century. These rare transits fall within several days of 8 May and 10 November.</p>

    <h2>Surface and Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>Mercury's surface resembles that of Earth's Moon, scarred by many impact craters resulting from collisions with meteoroids and comets. Large impact basins like Caloris and Rachmaninoff were created by asteroid impacts early in the solar system's history. There are large areas of smooth terrain and lobe-shaped scarps or cliffs formed as the planet's interior cooled and contracted over the billions of years since Mercury formed.</p>
    <p>Temperatures on Mercury's surface can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius) and drop to -290 degrees Fahrenheit (-180 degrees Celsius) at night. Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar wind and striking micrometeoroids. The atoms quickly escape into space and form a tail of neutral particles due to solar radiation pressure.</p>

    <h2>Magnetic Field and Structure</h2>
    <p>Mercury's magnetic field at the surface has just one percent the strength of Earth's but it interacts with the magnetic field of the solar wind to create intense magnetic tornadoes.</p>
    <p>Mercury is the second densest planet after Earth, with a large metallic core that has a radius of about 2,000 km, about 80 percent of the planet's radius. In 2007, researchers found evidence that the core is partly molten (liquid). Mercury's outer shell is only about 400 km thick.</p>

    <h2>Exploration History</h2>
    <p>The first spacecraft to visit Mercury was Mariner 10, which imaged about 45 percent of the surface. NASA's MESSENGER mission flew by Mercury three times in 2008-2009 and has been in orbit around the planet since 18 March 2011. MESSENGER observations have shown that the materials identified by radar are present only in regions of permanent shadow, consistent with the idea that they are cold enough to preserve water ice, despite the extreme high temperatures experienced by sunlit parts of the planet.</p>

    <h2>Name and Discovery</h2>
    <p>Mercury is named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods, Mercury, the god of commerce, which is the Roman counterpart to the ancient Greek god Hermes, the messenger of the gods. Significant observations include those by Thomas Harriott and Galileo Galilei in 1631 using the newly invented telescope. In 1631, Pierre Gassendi used a telescope to watch from Earth as Mercury crossed the face of the sun. In 1965, astronomers discovered that Mercury rotates three times for every two orbits, correcting the centuries-long belief that the same side of Mercury always faced the sun.</p>
