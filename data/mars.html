    <h2>Rover's Trip to Mars</h2>
    <p>Imagine Mars as a big, dusty, red playground in the sky! Farther than any place you've ever been, like if you took the longest road trip you've ever been on and multiplied it by a million. Now, once upon a time, a brave little robot named Rover set off on a cosmic journey and it zoomed through space. After a long journey through the empty, starry playground of space, Rover landed on Mars. There, it found mountains taller than anything we have on Earth and giant canyons deeper than you can imagine! And here's the craziest part, there might have once been water there, just like we have here on Earth. So, even though Mars might seem like a far-off, empty desert, it's full of wonders and secrets!</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Quick Facts</h2>

      <li><b>Day:</b> 9.92496 Hours</li>
      <li><b>Year:</b> 4,333 Earth days</li>
      <li><b>Radius:</b> 43,440.7 miles | 69,911 kilometers</li>
      <li><b>Planet Type</b> Gas giant</li>
      <li><b>Moons:</b> 53 confirmed | 14 provisional (for a possible total of 67 moons)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mars is a rocky body about half the size of Earth. As with the other terrestrial planets - Mercury, Venus, and Earth - volcanoes, impact craters, crustal movement, and atmospheric conditions such as dust storms have altered the surface of Mars.</p>
    
    <h2>Moons of Mars</h2>
    <p>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured asteroids. Phobos and Deimos are not spherical due to their low mass.</p>

    <h2>Climate and Geology</h2>
    <p>Mars experiences seasons due to the tilt of its rotational axis. Mars' polar ice caps grow and recede with the seasons, suggesting climate changes. Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and a spectacular equatorial canyon system, Valles Marineris. Volcanism in the highlands and plains was active more than 3 billion years ago.</p>

    <h2>Magnetic Field</h2>
    <p>Mars has no global magnetic field today. Traces of a magnetic field from 4 billion years ago exist in the Martian crust in the southern hemisphere.</p>

    <h2>Water on Mars</h2>
    <p>Mars experienced huge floods about 3.5 billion years ago. Recent missions to Mars have found hydrogen-rich polar deposits and structures and minerals indicating that liquid water once existed. The story of water on Mars could unlock its climate history and help understand planetary evolution.</p>
    <p>The cold temperatures and thin atmosphere on Mars do not allow liquid water to exist at the surface for long. The quantity of water required to carve Mars' great channels and flood plains is not evident today.</p>
    <p>In 2008, NASA's Phoenix Mars lander was the first mission to touch water ice in the Martian arctic. NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission with its large rover Curiosity is examining Martian rocks and soil, looking for signs of water and life.</p>
    
    <h2>How Mars Got its Name</h2>
    <p>Mars was named by the Romans for their god of war because of its red, bloodlike color. Other civilizations also named this planet from this attribute; for example, the Egyptians named it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one."</p>
