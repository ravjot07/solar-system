    <p>Unlike the brilliant, icy rings of Saturn, Jupiter's rings are delicate, dusty structures. And while Saturn's beautiful rings were first spotted in 1610, Jupiter's faint rings were not discovered until 1979 when NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft flew close to Jupiter. We now know all four giant planets of our solar system have rings.</p>
    <p>Jupiter's ring system has three main components: a pair of very faint outer rings called the gossamer rings; a wide, flat main ring; and a thick inner ring called the halo.</p>
    <p>The rings appear to be created by dust thrown off by impacts on small moons. The gossamer rings are bounded by the orbits of the moons Amalthea and Thebe. Adrastea and Metis skirt the outer edges of the main ring.</p>
